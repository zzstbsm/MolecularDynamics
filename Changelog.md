# Version 0.0.2

- System with FCC lattice and Simple Cubic lattice.
- Added ottimizations on the computation of potential and force: computation skipped if the distance of two atoms is greater than the cutoff.
- Added a CLI commands to take the parameters from command line: only the *new run* is working.

# Version 0.0.1

Basic features: compute evolution of a system with FCC lattice, Verlet integrator and no optimizations.
